## Notebooks Everywhere

Here is where all my notebooks from Google Colab and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sheikhartin) meet! :boom: The reason for creating most of these notebooks is curiosity, which sometimes goes to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfu2o2wsYq7XLJD5lLAQtg) for Farsi speakers!

### Contents

I preferred it to be categorized in this section rather than creating a separate folder... Now the name of the notebook (which may be different in different places) is mentioned along with a short description to make the choice easier...
