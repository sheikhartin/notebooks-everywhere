## Notebooks Everywhere

Here is where all my notebooks from Google Colab and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sheikhartin) meet! (It even includes local notebooks) Also, GitHub is more suitable for tweaking than other platforms... The reason for creating most of these notebooks is curiosity, which sometimes goes to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@artin-mohammadi) for Persian speaking audience!

### Contents

I preferred it to be categorized in this section rather than creating a separate folder... Now the name of the notebook (which may be different in different places) is mentioned along with a short description to make the choice easier.

_Note: Sometimes it is difficult to classify because a notebook can contain several subjects..._

#### Data Science

- [Exploratory data analysis on Titanic dataset](Titanic_EDA.ipynb): Nothing, just a simple EDA along with building models using FLAML on one of the most well-known datasets!

- [Exploring the car evaluation dataset](Car_Evaluation_EDA.ipynb): Another well-known dataset that we want to model using an AutoML framework...

- [Conditional formatting in Pandas](Conditional_Formatting_in_Pandas.ipynb): Style your tables and make them more attractive with these simple steps! â€” Exploration in the dataset of used cars

- [Working with large datasets in Pandas](Working_With_Large_Datasets_in_Pandas.ipynb): Pandas is not ideal for big data, but there are ways to improve performance.

- [Netflix EDA](Netflix_Movies_and_TV_Shows_EDA.ipynb): Analyzing an almost famous Netflix dataset inspired by different ideas...

- [Flagpedia web scraping](Flagpedia_Scraper.ipynb): Just a simple project for my YouTube channel.

- [Scraping an Iranian sock store](Scraping_an_Iranian_Sock_Store.ipynb): Just to practice how to use hidden APIs.

- [Cleaning data using shell scripting](Cleaning_Mobile_Phone_Price_Dataset_Using_Shell_Scripting.ipynb): In this notebook, we try to clean a dirty dataset with some basic Linux (Unix family in general) tools.

- [Analysis of mobile phone price](Mobile_Phone_Price_EDA.ipynb): Cleaning and exploring inside the mobile phone price dataset.

- [Developers tech stack scraper](Developers_Tech_Stack_Scraper.ipynb): A scraper to extract interesting data from software developers!

- [Geany themes scraper](Geany_Themes_Scraper.ipynb): Save time and energy by automatically downloading something!

- [Parts of a failed project](Parts_of_a_Failed_Project.ipynb): Three parts of a cryptocurrency trader bot project...

#### Machine Learning

- [Accuracy score measuring](Accuracy_Score_Measuring.ipynb): Implementation of some well-known metrics to get the accuracy of your model.

#### Deep Learning

- [Multi-layer perceptron from scratch](Multilayer_Perceptron_From_Scratch.ipynb): A good and useful experience of how a neural network works by implementing it after researching from different sources, which took about a week!

- [Logic gates in PyTorch](Logic_Gates_in_PyTorch.ipynb): Implementation of some logic gates such as XOR, OR, and AND in PyTorch.

#### Algorithms

- [Merge sort](Merge_Sort_Algorithm.ipynb): Merge sort is one of the fastest comparison-based sorting algorithms, which works on the principle of the divide and conquer approach.

#### Refactoring

- [Morse code translator](Morse_Code_Translator.ipynb): A tool to encode your messages into Morse code and decode it.

- [Lexical analyzer](A_Lexical_Analyzer.ipynb): Simply define your programming language tokens and then tokenize your code with it.

- [Balanced punctuations](Balanced_Punctuations.ipynb): Find out if the punctuations are pair or not!

#### Tasting

- [Gradio demo](Gradio_Demo.ipynb): Gradio is one of the fastest ways to make a quick demo for your damn functions with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it!

- [How to generate fake data](Creating_a_Fake_Dataset.ipynb): Here we will learn how to add some fake data to the PostgreSQL database to make us look more cool!
