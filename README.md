## Notebooks From Everywhere

This is the place where I keep my old and new notebooks... I sometimes use Google Colab and sometimes [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sheikhartin), but here is where they meet! I don't think more reason and explanation is needed :unamused: Oh, I was forgetting... The reason for creating most of these notebooks is curiosity, which sometimes goes to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfu2o2wsYq7XLJD5lLAQtg) channel for Farsi speakers! Sometimes blah blah blah blah blah blah :raised_hand:

### Contents

I preferred it to be categorized in this section rather than creating a separate folder... Now the name of the notebook (which may be different in different places) is mentioned along with a short description to make the choice easier...

#### Tasting

- [Gradio Demo](Gradio_Demo.ipynb): Gradio is one of the fastest ways to make a quick demo for your ML model with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it! (This is not just for highly specialized projects, you can even implement a [calculator](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/demo/calculator) with it)
- [Accuracy Score Measuring](Accuracy_Score_Measuring.ipynb): Implementation of some well-known metrics to get the accuracy of your model!
