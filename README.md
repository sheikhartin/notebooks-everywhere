## Notebooks Everywhere

Here is where all my notebooks from Google Colab and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sheikhartin) meet! (It even includes local notebooks) Also, GitHub is more suitable for tweaking than other platforms... The reason for creating most of these notebooks is curiosity, which sometimes goes to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfu2o2wsYq7XLJD5lLAQtg) for Farsi speakers!

### Contents

I preferred it to be categorized in this section rather than creating a separate folder... Now the name of the notebook (which may be different in different places) is mentioned along with a short description to make the choice easier...

#### Data Science

- [Exploratory data analysis on Titanic dataset](Titanic_EDA.ipynb): Nothing, just a simple EDA along with building models using FLAML on one of the most well-known datasets!

- [Exploring the car evaluation dataset](Car_Evaluation_EDA.ipynb): Another famous dataset that we analyze and build models using two different AutoML frameworks...

- [Conditional formatting in Pandas](Conditional_Formatting_in_Pandas.ipynb): Style your tables and make them more attractive with these simple steps! (It is not mandatory)

- [Working with large datasets in Pandas](Working_With_Large_Datasets_in_Pandas.ipynb): Pandas is not ideal for big data, but there are ways to improve performance.

#### Machine Learning

- [Accuracy score measuring](Accuracy_Score_Measuring.ipynb): Implementation of some well-known metrics to get the accuracy of your model.

#### Deep Learning

- [Multi-layer perceptron from scratch](Multilayer_Perceptron_From_Scratch.ipynb): A good and useful experience of how a neural network works by implementing it after researching from different sources, which took about a week!

- [Logic gates in PyTorch](Logic_Gates_in_PyTorch.ipynb): Implementation of some logic gates such as XOR, OR, and AND in PyTorch.

#### Algorithms

- [Merge sort](Merge_Sort_Algorithm.ipynb): Merge sort is one of the fastest comparison-based sorting algorithms, which works on the principle of the divide and conquer approach.

#### Tasting

- [Gradio demo](Gradio_Demo.ipynb): Gradio is one of the fastest ways to make a quick demo for your damn functions with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it!
